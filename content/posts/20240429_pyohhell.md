Here is the presentation of a python package allowing to play the 
"[Oh Hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh_hell)" card game. To install it, 
simply run:


```bash
pip install pyohhell
```

## Play a game

To create a game, simply instantiate a GameEngine object. You can then 
configure how points are awarded after each round of the game.

{{< code language="python" title="Create a game" id="1" expand="Show" collapse="Hide" isCollapsed="false" >}}

from game_state import DefaultPointAttributionStrategy

point_attribution_strategy = DefaultPointAttributionStrategy()

game_engine = GameEngine(point_attribution_strategy)

{{< /code >}}


You can then instantiate some Player objects and have them subscribe to the 
game. During an 'Oh Hell' game, players have two opportunities to make 
decisions: they must bid on how many tricks they will win during a round, and 
choose which card to play for each trick. The behavior of the Player class can 
be configured at instantiation with bid_selection_strategy and 
card_selection_strategy, both of which require an AbstractBidSelectionStrategy
and an AbstractCardSelectionStrategy object, respectively. The library 
includes some default strategies already implemented, but users can also 
create their own by implementing these abstract classes. 

{{< code language="python" title="Add players" id="2" expand="Show" collapse="Hide" isCollapsed="false" >}}

from src.pyohhell.player import Player

player_0 = Player(
    0, RandomCardSelectionStrategy(), RandomBidSelectionStrategy()
)
player_1 = Player(
    1, RandomCardSelectionStrategy(), RandomBidSelectionStrategy()
)

game_engine.subscribe_player(player_0)
game_engine.subscribe_player(player_1)

{{< /code >}}

You can then play a game by using the method: `play_game()`


{{< code language="python" title="Play a game" id="3" expand="Show" collapse="Hide" isCollapsed="false" >}}

points_by_player_id = game_engine.play_game()

{{< /code >}}

## Implement a bid selection strategy

To create a player that uses a custom bid strategy, you must develop a class 
that implements the `AbstractBidSelectionStrategy`. This involves implementing
a single method, `select_bid()`. Below is the code for the abstract class:

{{< code language="python" title="AbstractBidSelectionStrategy" id="4" expand="Show" collapse="Hide" isCollapsed="false" >}}

class AbstractBidSelectionStrategy:

    """
    Abstract class that defines the structure for bid selection strategy in
    a card game.
    """

    @abstractmethod
    def select_bid(
        self, hand: List[Card], authorised_bids: List[int],
        game_state: GameState
    ) -> Optional[int]:

        """
        Abstract method to select a bid in a card game.

        :param hand: The current hand of the player.
        :type hand: List[Card]
        :param authorised_bids: Bids that are allowed to be played based on
                                the game rules.
        :type authorised_bids: List[Card]
        :param game_state: The current state of the game.
        :type game_state: GameState
        :return: The selected card or None if no card can be selected.
        :rtype: Optional[Card]
        """

        pass

{{< /code >}}

For example, you can implement a strategy that selects the first bid from the 
authorised_bids list:

{{< code language="python" title="FirstBidSelectionStrategy" id="5" expand="Show" collapse="Hide" isCollapsed="false" >}}

class FirstBidSelectionStrategy(AbstractBidSelectionStrategy):

    """
    Strategy for selecting the first bid from the authorised cards.
    """

    def select_bid(
        self, hand: List[Card], authorised_bids: List[int],
        game_state: GameState
    ) -> Optional[int]:

        """
        Method to select the first bid from the authorised bids.

        :param hand: The current hand of the player.
        :type hand: List[Card]
        :param authorised_bids: Cards that are allowed to be played based on
                                 the game rules.
        :type authorised_bids: List[Card]
        :param game_state: The current state of the game.
        :type game_state: GameState
        :return: The selected card or None if no card can be selected.
        :rtype: Optional[Card]
        """

        if authorised_bids:
            return authorised_bids[0]
        else:
            return None

{{< /code >}}


## Implement a card selection strategy

To use a custom card selection strategy for a player, you must develop a class
that implements the `AbstractCardSelectionStrategy`. The required method to 
implement is `select_card()`. Below is the code for the 
`AbstractCardSelectionStrategy`:

{{< code language="python" title="AbstractCardSelectionStrategy" id="6" expand="Show" collapse="Hide" isCollapsed="false" >}}

class AbstractCardSelectionStrategy:

    """
    Abstract class that defines the structure for card selection strategy  in
    a card game.
    """

    @abstractmethod
    def select_card(
        self, hand: List[Card], authorised_cards: List[Card],
        game_state: GameState
    ) -> Optional[Card]:

        """
        Abstract method to select a card in a card game.

        :param hand: The current hand of the player.
        :type hand: List[Card]
        :param authorised_cards: Cards that are allowed to be played based on
                                 the game rules.
        :type authorised_cards: List[Card]
        :param game_state: The current state of the game.
        :type game_state: GameState
        :return: The selected card or None if no card can be selected.
        :rtype: Optional[Card]
        """

        pass

{{< /code >}}


Similarly to the bid strategy, you can implement a card selection strategy that
selects the first card from the list of authorised cards:

{{< code language="python" title="FirstCardSelectionStrategy" id="7" expand="Show" collapse="Hide" isCollapsed="false" >}}

class FirstCardSelectionStrategy(AbstractCardSelectionStrategy):

    """
    Strategy for selecting the first card from the authorised cards.
    """

    def select_card(
        self, hand: List[Card], authorised_cards: List[Card],
        game_state: GameState
    ) -> Optional[Card]:

        """
        Method to select the first card from the authorised cards.

        :param hand: The current hand of the player.
        :type hand: List[Card]
        :param authorised_cards: Cards that are allowed to be played based on
                                 the game rules.
        :type authorised_cards: List[Card]
        :param game_state: The current state of the game.
        :type game_state: GameState
        :return: The selected card or None if no card can be selected.
        :rtype: Optional[Card]
        """

        if authorised_cards:
            return authorised_cards[0]
        else:
            return None

{{< /code >}}
