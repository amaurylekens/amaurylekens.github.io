Here is the presentation of a python package allowing to play the 
"[Oh Hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh_hell)" card game. To install it, 
simply run:


```bash
pip install pyohhell
```

## Play a game

To create a game, simply instantiate a GameEngine object. You can then 
configure how points are awarded after each round of the game.

{{< code language="python" title="Create a game" id="1" expand="Show" collapse="Hide" isCollapsed="false" >}}

from game_state import DefaultPointAttributionStrategy

point_attribution_strategy = DefaultPointAttributionStrategy()

game_engine = GameEngine(point_attribution_strategy)

{{< /code >}}


You can then instantiate some Player objects and have them subscribe to the 
game. During an 'Oh Hell' game, players have two opportunities to make 
decisions: they must bid on how many tricks they will win during a round, and 
choose which card to play for each trick. The behavior of the Player class can 
be configured at instantiation with bid_selection_strategy and 
card_selection_strategy, both of which require an AbstractBidSelectionStrategy
and an AbstractCardSelectionStrategy object, respectively. The library 
includes some default strategies already implemented, but users can also 
create their own by implementing these abstract classes. 

{{< code language="python" title="Create a game" id="1" expand="Show" collapse="Hide" isCollapsed="false" >}}

from src.pyohhell.player import Player

player_0 = Player(
    0, RandomCardSelectionStrategy(), RandomBidSelectionStrategy()
)
player_1 = Player(
    1, RandomCardSelectionStrategy(), RandomBidSelectionStrategy()
)

game_engine.subscribe_player(player_0)
game_engine.subscribe_player(player_1)

{{< /code >}}

You can then play a game by using the method: `play_game()`


{{< code language="python" title="Create a game" id="1" expand="Show" collapse="Hide" isCollapsed="false" >}}

points_by_player_id = game_engine.play_game()
